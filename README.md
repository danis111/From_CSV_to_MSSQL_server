I am an SQL server develper who is eager to make researchers about database and sql

# From_CSV_to_MSSQL_server
convertion of datas from csv to sql 

1)I found out a data whose data type is csv 
2)fetched the data from csv to dataframe easily
3) deleted rows that have null,NaN or missing values
4)so I am not gonna encounter any erorr while inserting values into ms sql server
5)it is really gonna take you a couple of secs inserting about 17 thousand rows into sql server
6)I am using AWS for storing my databases.
